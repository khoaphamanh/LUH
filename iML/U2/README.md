# Interpretable Machine Learning: Exercise 2

## Instructions

1. Install the open-source-distribution [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
2. Create a new environment with python 3.9 and activate it. If you already created an environment for a previous exercise, feel free to reuse it.
```
conda create -n iML python=3.9
conda activate iML
```

3. Install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Add your code in all `tasks/*.py` files according to the exercise sheet (do not rename these files). Run them 
   individually with
   - `python tasks/decision_trees.py`
   - `python tasks/linear_models.py`
   - `python tasks/plotting.py`
5. Test your code or specific files with `pytest tests/*.py`.
6. Push your solution to your repository (remember to include the .png files for the plots).

Code is tested on Linux and Mac only. Testing is not guaranteed to work on Windows or VMs.
